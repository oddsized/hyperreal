The loss of self - multi disciplined research for human development and education in the future hyperreal

Media, education, art, technology, nature & philosophy in a technological singularity.

The loss of fantasy: "The one sided conservative coverage of certain important events and apparently less important facts leads to a one-sided public opinion. The conjunction of man with the overload of information, accelerated by modern technological media strategies, including all the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news, leads to an inevitable noise in which most man can only attend to contentment for themselves and their immediate environment through the benefits of financial security and status, and therefore can not afford to oppose the status quo. And without this resistance man automatically maintains, subscribes, proclaims and fools themselves into living delusions. When living in delusions, man can not tell the difference between what is real and what is fantasy."
