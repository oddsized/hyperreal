# hyperreal
Multi disciplined research for human development and education in the future hyperreal. 
Media, education, art, technology, nature & philosophy and our journey into the technological singularity.

In most of my philosophy i'm dealing with the concept of the hyperreal world. The following is an experimental approach describing the shift from media in reality towards a reality made by media. I was encouraged to write this after reading the https://github.com/nemild/hack-the-media repo by [Nemil Dalal](https://github.com/nemild).
Media has always been used as a tool to influence perceptions and behaviors of the masses.

#### General Observations

We all have acces to documented history, scientific research, recorded individual experiences and should be able to be aware of the underlying dogmas in society that crush our common sense. Events like 911 and recent Covid-19 should alert all of us to step up and consider a multifaceted opinion and gain a deeper understanding, as opposed to the superficial popular quasi-scientific worldview presented by news agencies, entertainment industries and government institutions. 

Which information deliberately wil not be disclosed and how the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news deliberately produces more noise and only leads to less understanding of the matter through disorientation and distraction.

#### Definition

There are various reasons for defining current media, including the so-called "new" media, as very conservative. The global capitalist economy, based on profit at the expense of others, arose from the prehistoric thinking of humanity in which life was still full of danger, food or food. Over the centuries this mentality has been used and transformed to keep people anxious and small in mind. This tactic is still used by those who want to retain power over others because they are also afraid and because it is very difficult for these people to let go. It is fear that causes people to accept dogmas that hide and deceive the truth of our thoughts and feelings. These thoughts cannot support a future for the free minded person, because for many of us human survival is still based on corruption from within.

Thinking about thoughts creates opposing thoughts that support and sustain the idea of the opposite. This is the basic principal that is used in the devide-and-rule tactics, sustained by conservative media through financial and political motives that stem from capitalism and the current conservative capitalist world order. For legally correct investments with a profit motive in money, entities are dependent on the monetary system. The monetary system depends globally on the central banks that depend on the one hand on perpetual debt agreements with local governments, on the lap boys of the financial rulers of history, and on the other hand on a substantial number of brainwashed citizens who value profits in money above human integrity, freedom and health of mind.

This interaction of dependencies puts enormous pressure on the monetary and socio-economic politics of all cooperating entities to maintain this global economic system, a single-market capitalism. This means that in principle all media that depend on investors with a profit motive in money are by definition conservative and collaborate to maintain the current economic system.

###### Note

Conservative media is not the so called Main Stream Media and is not defined by the technology that is used. The conservative media is a type of well established media and has overcome the shift from old media technologies to the internet very well, not limited to newspapers and television news channels.
The conservative media are widely represented and cited. They represent, often indirectly and unintentionally, as incompetent and dependent of the financial flows, the steering power of the most powerful entities on earth.
Apparent conflicts and opposite concepts from different conservative media, apparently mainstream and alternative, can basically use the same sources or combine different sources to still pursue the same motives.

Recognition points

The conservative media

    initially only seemingly to report events
    in the second instance question well-prepared 'experts' and witnesses
    one-sidedness; the same topics and views are extensively repeated
    are often the mouthpiece of the local government
    no attention for suspicions against governments
    no attention for and denial of various proven conspiracies
    use quasi-scientific explanations, backed by well-prepared 'experts' as scientific evidence
    use the same sources including the local state news office, Reuters, Wegener and Nasa.
    no attention for basic and clear controversial world issues.
    no attention for debate about changes to the central banking system or the perpetual debt agreements

Philosophical background

The hyperreal and the fiction of the human reality matrix opposed to historical facts, scientific evidence and the real experience.

The loss of fantasy: "The one sided conservative coverage of certain important events and apparently less important facts leads to a one-sided public opinion. The conjunction of man with the overload of information, accelerated by modern technological media strategies, including all the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news, leads to an inevitable noise in which most man can only attend to contentment for themselves and their immediate environment through the benefits of financial security and status, and therefore can not afford to oppose the status quo. And without this resistance man automatically maintains, subscribes, proclaims and fools themselves into living delusions. When living in delusions, man can not tell the difference between what is real and what is fantasy." Carl P. Müller 2018

Plato, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, Paul Virilio, Jean Baudrillard, Umberto Eco Plato discussed the 'ideal forms' of which our perception of reality was an approximation. In hyperreality, it is assumed that our approaches become detached from ideal forms, leaving our perceptions of reality based on other approaches, without the ability to restore the original true form. A multitude of dogmas stem from corruption in science and philosophy, which affect psychology, economics, and culture. On a psychological level, individuals are forced to conform to lies and to deny themselves until their authenticity becomes irrelevant, their individuality becomes annoying and the truth no longer has a voice. The most important notice about our Hyper-reality is the possibility of losing sight of the horizon of reality in a world intertwined with so many signs that only refer to concepts anchored in a virtual world and offered to us 24/7 in real time.

#### Examples

Multitude of Dogma’s in science 

Anything that challenges the dogmatic belief system of science is disregarded by the conservative media. "Science at its best is an open-minded method of inquiry, not a belief system." A thoughfull explanation by Rupert Sheldrake https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKHUaNAxsTg


##### Semantics

The real teachings in history have faded, commonsense does not apply to our hyperreality.

--

In Europe after the Second World War, people set up statues and memorials and every year people stand still and commemorate the atrocities during the Second World War. Respecting the victims and their relatives and thinking about history is of course a very good practice. Unfortunately, symbols have many different effects, depending on how and by whom they are used. However, the result of these public memorial ceremonies is unintentional or intentional part of a trauma-based mind control program. These memorials completely ignore the actual circumstances of a war, starting with a smart move in politics supported by mass psychology based on fear, and often an economic goal, perhaps hidden, in the background. These memorials point to symptoms of the human disease called war, expose people to traumatic thoughts and at the same time confirm the reality of fear.

### Hyperreal contradictions

The conservative media only repeat the scientific consensus In our hyperreality the originality of scientific research and the meaning of a scientific consensus should be questioned (politics vs science)


the climate change scientific consensus is in fact a religion based on political incentives


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientists_opposing_the_mainstream_scientific_assessment_of_global_warming Nobel Laureate Smashes the Global Warming Hoax CNN Slammed by John Coleman over Climate Change FRAUD Overshadowed by apparent more important topics (like the climate change debate) Man cannot or will not see exactly what is happening above his head. The Orwellian words 'thought crime' and 'crime stop' describe the concept of not being able to, and even intrinsically compulsive stop to think about certain subjects.

Health issues related to modern technologies, modern medicine, food and polution (including weather modification)

--- 

Human health, brainpower and consciousness are under pressure by modern technologies, environmental pollution, bad healthcare, insidious pharmaceuticals and the programming of society itself depending on marketing strategies. It becomes harder and harder each day to separate facts from fiction, to feel healthy and to know thou self. C-P Müller - the loss of fantasy


(scientific research on wifi, g4 and g5 radiation) - possibly causing cancer as stated by among others. the european commission scientific research on comparative radiation, waves and frequencies that break down the resistance system Public relations and false flags - new funded terrorism


The ridiculing of conspiracies by the conservative media are in contradiction with the long human history of proven conspiracies and the ease with which people are repeatedly misled. Eventually this will only lead to media and persons ridiculing themselves and distrust themselves. C-P Müller - Modern perspectives
