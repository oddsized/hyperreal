The topic of hyperreality is a fenomenon discussed in literature throughout history in different benamings. In the 21ste century the importance of reflection on the topics of hyperreality, simulacra, false believe and mindcontrol can not be emphasized enough concerning the fast growing global capitalist technocracy in a future technological singularity.

This text is aimed to propose a working structure and to create tools that can help individuals, groups and organisations to establish or re-invent their trajectatory in to the future with respect to our natural resources and human abilities.

These tools might be in the form of protocols, to tune in and out, reflections on discussions, to broader the horizon of mind, and meditation practices, to heal and re-connect.

1. Sense of reality - Awarness and the loss of self

The hyperreal and the fiction of the human reality matrix opposed to historical facts, scientific evidence and the real experience.

Plato discussed the 'ideal forms' of which our perception of reality was an approximation. In hyperreality, it is assumed that our approaches become detached from ideal forms, leaving our perceptions of reality based on other approaches, without the ability to restore the original true form. A multitude of dogmas stem from corruption in science and philosophy, which affect psychology, economics, and culture. On a psychological level, individuals are forced to conform to lies and to deny themselves until their authenticity becomes irrelevant, their individuality becomes annoying and the truth no longer has a voice. The most important notice about our Hyper-reality is the possibility of losing sight of the horizon of reality in a world intertwined with so many signs that only refer to concepts anchored in a virtual world and offered to us 24/7 in real time.

2. Politics of mind

Layers of meaning and illusions intertwine in personal experiences, distortions nuturing the self image from outside, always under the influence of a simulacra sustained by a capitalist technocracy. 

- the use and exploit of innovation 

- politics, capitalism, mind and technocracy

The loss of fantasy: "The one sided conservative coverage of certain important events and apparently less important facts leads to a one-sided public opinion. The conjunction of man with the overload of information, accelerated by modern technological media strategies, including all the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news, leads to an inevitable noise in which most man can only attend to contentment for themselves and their immediate environment through the benefits of financial security and status, and therefore can not afford to oppose the status quo. And without this resistance man automatically maintains, subscribes, proclaims and fools themselves into living delusions. When living in delusions, man can not tell the difference between what is real and what is fantasy."
