The hyperreal and the fiction of the human reality matrix opposed to historical facts, scientific evidence and the real experience.

Plato discussed the 'ideal forms' of which our perception of reality was an approximation. In hyperreality, it is assumed that our approaches become detached from ideal forms, leaving our perceptions of reality based on other approaches, without the ability to restore the original true form. A multitude of dogmas stem from corruption in science and philosophy, which affect psychology, economics, and culture. On a psychological level, individuals are forced to conform to lies and to deny themselves until their authenticity becomes irrelevant, their individuality becomes annoying and the truth no longer has a voice. The most important notice about our Hyper-reality is the possibility of losing sight of the horizon of reality in a world intertwined with so many signs that only refer to concepts anchored in a virtual world and offered to us 24/7 in real time.
