The topic of hyperreality is a fenomenon discussed in literature throughout history in different benamings. In the 21ste century the importance of continious reflection on the topics of hyperreality, simulacra, false believe and mindcontrol can not be emphasized enough concerning the fast growing global capitalist technocracy in a future technological singularity.

This text is aimed to propose a working structure and to create tools that can help individuals, groups and organisations to establish or re-invent their trajectatory in to the future with respect to the natural human abbilities.

These tools might be in the form of protocols, to tune in and out, reflections on discussions, to broader the horizon of mind, and meditation practices, to heal and re-connect.

The loss of fantasy: "The one sided conservative coverage of certain important events and apparently less important facts leads to a one-sided public opinion. The conjunction of man with the overload of information, accelerated by modern technological media strategies, including all the apparent pluralistic duality between regular and alternative news, leads to an inevitable noise in which most man can only attend to contentment for themselves and their immediate environment through the benefits of financial security and status, and therefore can not afford to oppose the status quo. And without this resistance man automatically maintains, subscribes, proclaims and fools themselves into living delusions. When living in delusions, man can not tell the difference between what is real and what is fantasy."
